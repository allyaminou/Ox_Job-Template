# Template using **ox_core & ox_target** to develop jobs for players
This is a WIP and will most likey just be a bare template for developers to utilize for their own servers

## Current tasks

* Target player & peds for interactions
* Target objects for interaction
* Spawn vehicle for player (utilize ox_lib)
* Set markers to locations
* Use progress circle for work animation

Example: *Players working as police can detain & escort peds to move them out of the way or EMS can revive the peds*
